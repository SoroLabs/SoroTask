# Dead-Letter Queue Implementation Checklist

## Issue Requirements

### ✅ Define retry thresholds and permanent-failure criteria
- [x] Configurable `DLQ_MAX_FAILURES` threshold (default: 5)
- [x] Configurable `DLQ_FAILURE_WINDOW_MS` time window (default: 1 hour)
- [x] Error classification system (retryable, non-retryable, duplicate)
- [x] Automatic quarantine on threshold exceeded
- [x] Immediate quarantine for non-retryable errors
- [x] Documentation of criteria in user guide

### ✅ Add a dead-letter record or quarantine state for exhausted tasks
- [x] `DeadLetterQueue` class implementation
- [x] Quarantine state tracking (Set of quarantined task IDs)
- [x] Dead-letter record structure with full context
- [x] Persistent storage to `data/dead-letter-queue.json`
- [x] Status tracking (quarantined/recovered)
- [x] Automatic save on state changes

### ✅ Store enough execution context for operators to diagnose the failure later
- [x] Full error messages, codes, and stack traces
- [x] Task configuration snapshots (sanitized)
- [x] Execution phase tracking
- [x] Transaction hash (when available)
- [x] Attempt number tracking
- [x] Error pattern analysis with confidence scores
- [x] Last 10 failures preserved per task
- [x] First and last failure timestamps

### ✅ Prevent quarantined tasks from being retried in normal loops
- [x] O(1) quarantine check using Set
- [x] Filter quarantined tasks in `ExecutionQueue.enqueue()`
- [x] Separate tracking from failed tasks
- [x] Metric for skipped quarantined tasks
- [x] Zero performance impact on healthy tasks

### ✅ Expose metrics or logs for dead-letter activity
- [x] Prometheus metrics (4 new metrics)
- [x] HTTP REST endpoints (2 endpoints)
- [x] Event emission (4 event types)
- [x] Structured logging throughout
- [x] Statistics API
- [x] Record inspection API
